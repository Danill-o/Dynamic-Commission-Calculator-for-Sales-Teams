➢ Introduction 
The Dynamic Commission Calculator for Sales Teams is a system designed to automate, streamline, and enhance how sales commissions are calculated within an organisation.  Traditionally, many companies rely on manual spreadsheets and fixed percentage rules,  
which are time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to update when sales policies change. This project solves these challenges by building a flexible PL/SQL-based solution that automatically computes commissions based on sales performance, product  categories, sales targets, and personalised business rules. 
The system ensures accuracy, fairness, and transparency between management and sales teams. It also improves productivity by reducing administrative workload and providing immediate feedback on sales performance. The project is suitable for companies with varying commission structures, including tiered schemes, product-specific percentages, or incentive bonuses. 

🎯 Problem Statement
Sales organizations struggle with manual, error-prone commission calculations that lack real-time processing, dynamic rule application, and comprehensive analytics. This system automates commission calculations with business intelligence capabilities to solve:

 	Manual calculation errors and delays

 	Lack of real-time commission processing

 	Inconsistent application of commission rules

 	Limited analytics for decision-making

 	No comprehensive audit trail
